# Working with folders

A list or library can use folders to build a structure to manage the list items or files. Folders can also exist at the [IWeb](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html) level, so outside the context of a list or library.

In the remainder of this article you'll see a lot of `context` use: in this case this is a `PnPContext` which was obtained via the `PnPContextFactory` as explained in the [overview article](readme.md) and show below:

```csharp
using (var context = await pnpContextFactory.CreateAsync("SiteToWorkWith"))
{
    // See next chapter on how to use the PnPContext for working with folders
}
```

## Getting folders

Lists and libraries do have a [RootFolder property](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IList.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IList_RootFolder) allowing you to enumerate content inside, but also the [IWeb](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html) has a [collection of Folders](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IWeb_Folders), a [RootFolder](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html#collapsible-PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IWeb_RootFolder) and [GetFolderByIdAsync](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html#collapsible-PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IWeb_GetFolderByIdAsync_Guid_Expression_Func_PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_System_Object_____) and [GetFolderByServerRelativeUrlAsync](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html#collapsible-PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IWeb_GetFolderByServerRelativeUrlAsync_System_String_Expression_Func_PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_System_Object_____) methods. All of these approach either give you an [IFolder](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolder.html) or an [IFolderCollection](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolderCollection.html) that you can use to work with.

```csharp
// Get a folder by loading it via it's server relative url
var folder = await context.Web.GetFolderByServerRelativeUrlAsync($"{context.Uri.PathAndQuery}/SiteAssets"); 

// Get a folder by id
var folder = await context.Web.GetFolderByIdAsync(new Guid("d50ec969-cb27-4a49-839f-3c25d1d607d5")); 

// Get a folder via the list
var folder = (await context.Web.Lists.GetByTitleAsync("Documents", p => p.RootFolder)).RootFolder;

// Get root folder of a library
IFolder folder = await context.Web.Folders.Where(f => f.Name == "SiteAssets").FirstOrDefaultAsync();

// Get root folder of the web (for files living outside of a document library)
IFolder folder = (await context.Web.GetAsync(p => p.RootFolder)).RootFolder;

// Get folder collection of a web and pick the SiteAssets folder
await context.Web.LoadAsync(p => p.Folders);
var folder = context.Web.Folders.AsRequested().FirstOrDefault(p=>p.Name == "SiteAssets");
```

### The Folder property bag

Each folder also has a so called property bag, a list key/value pairs providing more information about the folder. You can read this property bag, provided via the [IFolder Properties property](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolder.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_Properties), and add new key/value pairs to it.

```csharp
// Get a folder by loading it via it's server relative url, also load the properties (= property bag)
var folder = await context.Web.GetFolderByServerRelativeUrlAsync($"{context.Uri.PathAndQuery}/SiteAssets", f => f.Properties); 

// Enumerate the folder property bag
foreach(var property in folder.Properties)
{
    // Do something with the property
}

// Add a new property
folder["myPropertyKey"] = "Some value";
await folder.Properties.UpdateAsync();
```

## Adding folders

When working with folders there always is a root folder or folder collection present, a web has a root folder and folders collection and lists and libraries have a root folder. Adding folders implies adding folder as sub folder of an existing folder and this can be done by adding a new IFolder into an [IFolderCollection](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolderCollection.html) by using the Add methods or using [EnsureFolderAsync](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolder.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_EnsureFolderAsync_System_String_).

>[!Note]
> Before you can add folders to a list the list needs to be enabled for folder creation by setting the [EnableFolderCreation property](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IList.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IList_EnableFolderCreation) to true.

```csharp
// Get the root folder of the Documents library
var folder = (await context.Web.Lists.GetByTitleAsync("Documents", p => p.RootFolder)).RootFolder;

// Add a folder 
var subFolder = await folder.Folders.AddAsync("My folder");
```

### Ensure a folder path

When adding folders a very convenient method to use is the [EnsureFolderAsync](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolder.html#PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_EnsureFolderAsync_System_String_) method as this one can take a folder path and verify each part of the path and create it if needed.

```csharp
// Get the root folder of the Site Pages library
IFolder folder = (await context.Web.Lists.GetByTitleAsync("Site Pages", p => p.RootFolder)).RootFolder;

// Below command will result in a folder hierarchy sub1/sub2/sub3/sub4/sub5, 5 levels deep
var subFolder = await folder.EnsureFolderAsync("sub1/sub2/sub3/sub4/sub5");
```

## Adding content in folders

Folders can contain other folders, but the common use case for folders is to hold files, see the [Files documentation](files-intro.md) to learn how to add a file into a folder.

## Updating folders

All but one IFolder properties are readonly, the only one that can be set is the [WelcomePage property](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IFolder.html#collapsible-PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IFolder_WelcomePage) and setting this property only makes sense on the [web's RootFolder](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html#collapsible-PnP_Core_Model_SharePoint_IWeb_RootFolder) as that property determines the web's home page to load.

```csharp
// Check if the RootFolder property was loaded, if not request it from the server
await context.Web.EnsurePropertiesAsync(p => p.RootFolder);

// Set the WelcomePage and update the folder
context.Web.RootFolder.WelcomePage = "sitepages/myhomepage.aspx";
await context.Web.RootFolder.UpdateAsync();
```

## Deleting folders

```csharp
// Get the root folder of the Site Pages library
IFolder folder = (await context.Web.Lists.GetByTitleAsync("Site Pages", p => p.RootFolder)).RootFolder;

// Add a folder 
var subFolder = await folder.Folders.AddAsync("My folder");

// Delete the folder again
await subFolder.DeleteAsync();
```

## Getting changes for a folder

You can use the `GetChanges` methods on an `IFolder` to list all the changes. See [Enumerating changes that happened in SharePoint](changes-sharepoint.md) to learn more.
