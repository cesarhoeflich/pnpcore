# Working with sites

In SharePoint there are site collections and inside a site collection you have at least one web (the root web), which on it's own can have other webs (child webs). Quite often when talking about a web the term site or sub site is used. When using the PnP Core SDK a site collection is referred to via the [ISite interface](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.ISite.html) while a web (root web, child web or sub web) is defined via the [IWeb interface](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html).

In the remainder of this article you'll see a lot of `context` use: in this case this is a `PnPContext` which was obtained via the `PnPContextFactory` as explained in the [overview article](readme.md) and show below:

```csharp
using (var context = await pnpContextFactory.CreateAsync("SiteToWorkWith"))
{
    // See next chapter on how to use the PnPContext for working with sites
}
```

## Getting a site

A `PnPContext` always has a reference to the [ISite](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.ISite.html) of the underlying site collection and the [IWeb](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/api/PnP.Core.Model.SharePoint.IWeb.html) of the connected site, so getting the current Site is as a simple as using the Site property on the PnPContext. When a context is created the Site and Web properties are loaded with some elementary properties like Id and GroupId.

```csharp
var site = context.site;
var id = site.Id;
```

If you want to load additional site properties you can do that via using one of the Get methods:

```csharp
// Load the root folder 
await context.Web.LoadAsync(p => p.RootFolder);

// Load the hub site id
var site = await context.Site.GetAsync(p => p.HubSiteId);
Console.WriteLine(site.HubSiteId);
```

## Getting changes for a site

You can use the `GetChanges` methods on an `ISite` to list all the changes. See [Enumerating changes that happened in SharePoint](changes-sharepoint.md) to learn more.
